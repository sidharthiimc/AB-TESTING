    "The biggest e-commerce company called <b>FaceZonGoogAppFlix</b> as approached us (a data science consulting firm) as a new client! \r\n",

    "They have a potential new webpage designed with the intention to increase their current conversion rates of 12% by 0.35% or more. With such an ambiguous task, they have full trust in us to give them a recommendation whether to implement the new page or keep the old page. Unforunately they haven't built up a data science capability in their company, but they've used an external software called 'A/B Tester' for 23 days and come back to us with a dataset. What do we do?\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The goal of this notebook will serve as a primer into A/B testing and go through as many of the foundations of A/B testing I found online. In my opinion, A/B testing isn't really explored properly or well enough, so hopefully this notebook will fill in this void. Through this notebook, I've placed some references and consolidated pieces of their methodologies here.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "    This notebook assumes a very surface and high-level level understanding of A/B Testing - a statistical way to compare two or more versions (A or B?) to determine not only which one performs better but also to understand if the difference between two of them is statistically significant (Data Science Dojo, 2018).\r\n",
    "    \r\n",
    "    Furthermore, the current conversion rate of 12% is chosen from assumptions from the control data, and the intention to increase conversion rates by 0.35% is intentionally chosen as the lowest practical value to achieve the highest minimum Sample Size required. More on these later."

But what if we checked the proportion AFTER the test was (33/67)? Maybe the A/B test software had a bug? Maybe the code to split the traffic had a bug? Either way...If this split drastically changes throughout our experiment, our data is inherently wrong.\r\n",

Therefore, we'll set $D_{min}$ = 0.0035. The 0.0035 is also usually a sign that our clients are a big e-commerce company and such an increase in conversion would have a huge impact on their top-line (Yu, 2020)."

    "While this was a satisfactory A/B test, A/B test data in a real-life setting will not be as clear-cut as what we've been provided.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Designing the A/B test involves many steps to prevent factors that threaten your validity:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. Issues such as the seasonality effect need to be heavily considered. An individual user's behaviour will change a lot depending on time, what day of the week it is (weekday vs weekend) and seasonality. A solution would be the hold-back method: launch the change to everyone except for one small hold-back group of users, and continue comparing their behavior to the control group (Peng, 2017). In our case, our A/B test was run over a duration of over 3 weeks right after the New Year, which should smooth out seasonality effects.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. Other noteworthy and more direct psychological effects are change aversion and the novelty effect which affect our treatment group. Cohort Analysis may be helpful (Peng, 2017).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. There can be statistical issues such as Interference, where the assumption of independence is violated between treatment and control groups. Interference will result in what is often known as the overestimation bias, because resources are being co-utilized by members in both control and treatment groups (Rosidi, 2021).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. Business Impact discussions can involve engineering costs/maintenance, customer support, opportunity cost, etc. If we run a successful A/B test and decide on changing our website that results in a worthwhile increase in our metric, but our ongoing costs off-set this, then that must be taken into consideration (Peng, 2017).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "5. There are even considerably minute effects that could poison our A/B test data, such as the flicker effect: This is when the original variation flashes on the treatment user's screens before variation B gets loaded (Dube, 2019)."
